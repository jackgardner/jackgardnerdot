I've been doing some thinking recently around Javascript tooling and if there really is a 'perfect' toolbox.  We're all familiar with the saying 'use the right tool for the job', but often the temptation is to find a one-size-fits-all tool and simply apply that to any problem you might face.  Of course, the chief offender of this is JQuery simply due to its massive popularity. 

While I'm by no means against JQuery, it does have its pitfalls in making things too easy for a developer.  Let me explain - how many times have you read into the Jquery source and can say for sure exactly how the event system works?  What about the infinitely useful $.ajax function?   We can become far too reliant on these mechanisms - something I see all too often in junior developers - without realising that accomplishing something similar in pure Javascript is trivial and often much quicker.
